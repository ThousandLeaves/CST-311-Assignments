## Subnet Addressing (In Mininet)
This Python Mininet script describes a 2 host network that is connected via a legacy router. Both hosts may send packets to each other using subnet addressing techniques to allow both hosts to forward packets between themselves.

## UDP Pinger
The UDP pinger is exactly what its name suggests: A pinging script that uses the UDP protocol to send and receiving datagram packets. Because UDP is an unreliable transfer protocol, there exists functionality for handling the exception of a timeout while waiting for a response from the host. Outputs for each ping include the RTT (round trip time), the number of packets lost, and the packet loss rate.
